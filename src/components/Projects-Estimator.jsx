              This is a linear regression model which uses data regarding
              mileage, engine power, transmission and other technical details to
              estimate the value of an car. This was done using the{" "}

              <br></br> Data for this model was cleaned using Google Sheets and
              overall this project was fun in the making even though the
              accuracy was horrible and when I tried to optimize for loss it got
              worse. This is mainly due to there being extreme outliers in the
              dataset (ie. two cars of very similar make a model could sell for
              $300 or $8000 respectively due to one being esentially scrap metal
              and undrivable where as the other was in excellent condition).

              <br></br> In the future I may use some Google Sheets wizardry to
              clean up the outliers, but for now I'm focussing on other more
              complex machine learning projects such as a convolutional neural
              network that extrapolates edges to an landscape image which don't
              exist the original image. (Coming soon!) ðŸŒ†{" "}

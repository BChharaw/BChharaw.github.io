            When I was first learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS I made this
            simplistic website that tracks your goals using cookies in the
            browser. <br></br>
            <br></br> I made it for personal use to hold myself more
            accountable for the goals I set as I set it as my default browser
            homepage (worked wonders with
            my productivity in high school). <br></br>
            <br></br> Everyday it allows you to set exactly one goal for that
            day and will display previous goals which you made in the past as
            a list. You can edit the day's goal by typing something new. <br></br><br></br>Nothing more, nothing less, simplistic as it should be! üòé{" "}
